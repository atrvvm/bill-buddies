# BillBuddies - Shared Expense Tracker

## Overview
BillBuddies is a web application built to help groups of people track shared expenses. Whether it's a group of friends on a trip, roommates sharing bills, or a project team managing expenses, BillBuddies allows users to track who owes what to whom. Users can sign up, log in, create groups, add expenses, and view a breakdown of the amounts owed by each member of the group.

This application utilizes **React** on the front-end, a **Node.js and Express.js** backend with **GraphQL** for data querying and mutations, **MongoDB** for storing data, and **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for user authentication.
